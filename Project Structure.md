Step 1
Project Name: EnRouteAR

Purpose:
EnRouteAR is a web-based augmented reality (AR) application designed to assist users in navigating and exploring their surroundings. The project leverages the capabilities of A-Frame, AR.js, and Mapbox to create an immersive experience where users can receive directions, view 3D models of destinations, and interact with the environment.

Overview: 
1.  Loading the Page:  Users open the link in a browser on their mobile device.
2.  Permissions: 
   - The website requests and obtains necessary permissions:
     - Location Access: Using the Geolocation API to access the user's current location.
     - Camera Access: Using the getUserMedia API to enable camera access.
3.  Interface:  The webpage displays "College Campus AR Navigation" with a title and description.
4.  AR Scene Setup:  The A-Frame library and AR.js are included for augmented reality features. AR scene initialized with the user's camera and a GPS-based camera.
5.  Save Destinations Location:  Destinations (departments, hostels, canteen, ground, library, etc.) have specified latitude and longitude that are set manually in `places.js`.
6.  Navigation Features: 
   - A select destination bar allows users to choose their destination preferences.
   - The device's camera feed is opened, overlaying AR elements on top.
7.  Selecting a Destination:  Users can select a destination by clicking on the select destination bar.
8.  Initiating Navigation:  When a destination is selected, the system gets the user's current location. The `getDirections` function is used to obtain route information to the selected destination. AR elements are updated based on the received directions.
9.  Displaying Navigation Information:  AR elements may include 3D arrows guiding the user along roads, avoiding obstacles. A 2D map on the lower screen displays the user's location, destination, and route using markers and lines.
10.  User Interaction:  Users visually follow AR markers and directional arrows to reach their selected destination.

Project Structure:

-  index.html: 
  - The main HTML file serving as the entry point for the web application. It includes references to essential scripts, libraries (A-Frame, AR.js, Mapbox), and stylesheets.

-  models: 
  - This directory holds 3D models used within the application, contributing to the augmented reality experience.
    -  Canteen.mtl, Canteen.obj:  3D model representing a canteen destination.
    
-  scripts: 
  - This directory contains JavaScript files responsible for the application's functionality.
    -  aframe-ar.js:  A local copy of A-Frame, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.
    -  aframe-v1.5.0.min.js:  A minified version of A-Frame.
    -  ar-threex-location-only.js
    -  places.js:  Stores predefined places with names and locations.
    -  script.js:  Handles user interaction, gets directions, and updates AR elements.

-  styles: 
  - This directory holds CSS files used to style the web application.
    -  index.css:  Stylesheet for enhancing the visual presentation of the web application.

Development Process:

1.  HTML Structure: 
   - Create the basic HTML structure with references to A-Frame, AR.js, and stylesheets.

2.  Places Data (`places.js`): 
   - Define an array of predefined places with names and coordinates, providing data for the application.

3.  AR Components (`gps-new-entity-place.js`, `gps-new-camera.js`): 
   - Register components for AR entities, the GPS-based camera.

4.  Navigation Script (`script.js`): 
   - Write a script to handle user interaction, obtain directions, and update AR elements based on Mapbox data.

5.  Testing: 
   - Test the project in different environments to ensure proper functionality.

6.  Debugging: 
   - Address any issues or errors that arise during testing, enhancing the application's reliability.

7.  Optimization: 
   - Optimize the project for better performance and an improved user experience.

8.  Deployment: 
   - Host the project on a platform like GitHub Pages for public access.

Conclusion:
EnRouteAR provides users with an interactive and engaging way to navigate their surroundings using augmented reality. The combination of A-Frame, AR.js, and Mapbox enables a seamless experience, offering both 2D and 3D perspectives for effective navigation. The project's well-organized structure and documentation facilitate collaboration and further development.

Step 2
I will provide you code for `index.html`, `index.css`, `places.js`, `script.js`. I cannot provide `aframe-ar.js`, `aframe-v1.5.0.min.js`, `ar-threex-location-only.js` because they are lengthy and downloaded from GitHub.

Step 3
Ask me that all codes one by one.
